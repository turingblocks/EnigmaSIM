# EnigmaSIM
Javascript based Engima Emulator with three rotors.

The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early to mid 20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Extensively used by Germany during World War II.

Using Javascript, this is a basic Engima Emulator featuring three rotors.

NB: In a real Enigma machine, an extra level of complexity can be added by using the plugboard - a set of cables and sockets that can be used to re-map the keys on the keyboard.
